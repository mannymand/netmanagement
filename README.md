# Network Management Tool
Program to allow network administrators to supervise individual devices in a network, whether it be a switch, a router or any other SNMP enabled device. The objective of this final project was to write a tool in C++ that allows management of a network that may have up to 10 switches and 5 routers. 

This program achieves the following;
•Initializes the random access file switches.dat to 10 empty records  
•Initializes the random access file routers.dat to 5 empty records  
•Allows you to input the data concerning each switch or router  
•Allows you to list all your switches or routers and their port states  
•Allows you to delete a record for a switch or a router that you no longer have on the network  
•Allows you update any information in either file
